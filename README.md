# AutomotiveTrackingSystem_Cpp
Codes were written in C++ to track Automotive System.  This is OOP (Object Oriented Programming) design.

======================================= Question

QUESTION:

Create a simple object oriented library for tracking automobile maintenance. The system should support at least 
three car types: electric, gas and diesel. 

Each vehicle should have at minimum a make, model, year and odometer reading. Maintenance tasks should include 2-3 
things like oil changes or tire rotations. However, not all maintenance tasks can be applied to all vehicles (an 
electric car wonâ€™t need an oil change).

The library or API should be capable of listing, adding, updating and removing entries at runtime. Supply unit tests 
to demonstrate your features.
